### üèä [FORM Swim](https://www.formswim.com/) Projects
---

At form, I worked with the Software QA team to continuously test & validate FORM's embedded firmware and mobile software. 
More interestingly, I proposed and led the development of an internal tool -- QA Terminal.

Sorry, the source code for this project is not available. 

**QA Terminal**
- Led the development of this Python-based GUI application to combine 10+ critical testing functions and accelerate testing
- Demonstrated a passion for learning by independently mastering 4 new BLE, GUI, and cloud libraries to innovate new functionality
- Developed a proprietary Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Python API for FORM devices to facilitate remote control & file transfer 
- Leveraged AWS services and embedded C++ utilities to enable rapid firmware deployment and verification
- Optimized and increased USB-Serial data processing speed by 80% (compared to previous tools) to enable faster insights
