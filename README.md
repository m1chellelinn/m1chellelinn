# A bit about me

 I am fast-learning and hard-working, and I enjoy working with a team of people. I have a passion for computer hardware and software that stems from being a member of the[ UBC Solar student design team](https://ubcsolar.com/). 
 
 Outside of Solar and classes, I enjoy [landscape painting on a digital format](https://github.com/m1chellelinn/m1chellelinn/blob/939ea291932c3ab1c58e49702ff3c69864b2a7f8/artwork/description.md), music, and casual sports!

  - From this short time studying at UBC, I‚Äôm already competent in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and SystemVerilog; and practices such as embedded programming basics, testing, thread safety, documentation, and much more. At UBC Solar, I‚Äôm constantly awed by the size and complexity of circuits and firmware that go into controlling the solar car battery I‚Äôm working on.
  - I enjoy playing the trombone and piano. My profile picture to the left is actually taken from one of our band concerts.
  - I love going cycling, skiing (but it's so expensive), and swimming.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è UBC Solar Projects

---

**Github CI/CD Pipeline Automations** 
- Eliminated manual file update work by developing automation tools with Git and GitHub Actions
- Automatically managed file version descriptions by creating and executing Python scripts in a Linux environment
- Enhanced and formalized build process for embedded C source files by using PlatformIO build tools  
- Ensured code quality and correctness by communicating decisions, considerations, and drawbacks via code-reviews 


**Ventilation Intakes for a Battery Pack**

- Led the design of custom 3D-printed ventilation intakes for the Solar car battery to ensure sufficient cooling airflow through the battery.
- Applied the engineering design process to settle on one design that conforms to the tight geometry inside the car while moving a sufficient amount of air.
- Continuously presented design features, considerations, and drawbacks to team leads and executives during ‚Äúdesign reviews‚Äù.

**Waterproof Cover for a Vital Circuit**

- Led the design of a custom 3D-printed water-tight enclosure to cover a vulnerable & critical circuit board on the Solar car battery.
- Applied problem-solving skills by resolving difficult design elements demanded by electronics team.
- Efficiently communicated design choices, feasibility, and performance to team executives.

**Fitting a DC-DC Converter**

- Collaborated with electronics team executive to finalize placement of a new, bigger DC-DC converter on the car battery‚Äôs electronic control unit (ECU).
- Applied 3D design skills in Solidworks by modifying ECU housing.

(Notes: To comply with UBC course policy, I have hidden the source code for my projects. )

&nbsp;

[**Client-Server Simulation Implementation ‚Äî CPEN221**](https://cpen221ubc.notion.site/MP3-IoT-Data-Analytics-f2b1469b01984c2aa9b7dd673dc6b74f)

- Spearheaded development of our Java program by constructing a model of interactions between the client, ‚Äúmessage handler,‚Äù and server.
- Ensured our team‚Äôs success in meeting the deadline by listing components of our implementation and dividing them to me and my teammates: Mir Afeef and Luc Forbes.
- Implement a multithreaded server that automatically optimizes computation to serve multiple clients without compromise.
- Applied professional practices such as unit & integration testing, thread-safe programming, and class & method documentation to produce clean code.


**Reduced Instruction-Set Computer (RISC) ‚Äî CPEN211**

- Programmed a Turing-complete RISC CPU in System Verilog in 4 weeks by applying computer hardware principles.
- Efficiently utilized the pair-programming technique with my partner, Matthew Frew, to build a correct implementation and significantly reduce debugging time.
- Rigorously tested and simulated our RISC by building testbenches for each of its components in Modelsim.
- Went beyond course expectations and optimized our RISC implementation to achieve a CPU performance that ranked top 10 in our class.


[**Computations & Simulations with Graphs ‚Äî CPEN221**](https://cpen221ubc.notion.site/MP2-Graphs-Sea-Levels-Mind-Boggles-85789d5808aa4ebf8ab1f30e88059a1a)
- Programmed two robust implementations of mathematical graphs to simulate sea levels, calculate connections, and more.
- Applied leadership skills by setting team meetings and splitting tasks to my teammates: Mir Afeef and Luc Forbes.
