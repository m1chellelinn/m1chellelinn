# üëã Welcome! Here's a bit about me
In my second year of computer engineering at UBC, I'm always ready to learn new things about computer software and hardware. From the UBC Solar design team, I developed a passion and awe for the size and compexity of our software, firmware, and circuits. This motivates me to try to learn all about them. 
Below, you can find the details of most (if not all) of my projects. Thank you for reviewing my portfolio! üòé

# All My Past Projects



### Personal Projects

### UBC Solar Projects

### UBC Course Projects

****************Client-Server Simulation Implementation, CPEN221****************

- Spearheaded development of our program by constructing a model of interactions between the client, ‚Äúmessage handler‚Äù, and server.
- Ensured our team‚Äôs by listing components of our implementation and dividing them to my teammates: Mir Ruwayd Afeef and Luc Forbes.
- Applied Java concurrency principles to implement a thread-safe program that serves multiple clients at the same time.
- Applied software testing principles to create a suite of black-box tests that covers (almost) every line and branch in our implementation.

********Reduced Instruction-Set Computer (RISC), CPEN211********

- Applied computer hardware principles (logic building blocks, registers, arithmetic logic unit, etc.) to write System Verilog code for a Turing-complete RISC cpu.
- Efficiently utilized the pair-programming technique with my partner, Matthew Frew, to build a correct implementation and significantly reduce debugging time.
- Rigorously tested and simulated our RISC by building testbenches for each of its components in  Modelsim.
- Went beyond course expectations and optimized our RISC implementation to achieve a cpu performance that ranked top 10 in our class.

**Ventilation Intakes for a Battery Pack, UBC Solar**

- Led the design of custom 3D-printed ventilation intakes for the Solar car battery to ensure sufficient cooling airflow through the battery.
- Applied the engineering design process to settle on one design that conforms to the tight geometry inside the car while moving a sufficient amount of air.
- Continuously presented design features, considerations, and drawbacks to team leads and executives during ‚Äúdesign reviews‚Äù.

**Waterproof Cover for a Vital Circuit, UBC Solar**

- Led the design of a custom 3D-printed water-tight enclosure to cover a vulnerable & critical circuit board on the Solar car battery.
- Applied problem-solving skills by resolving difficult design elements demanded by electronics team.
- Efficiently communicated design choices, feasibility, and performance to team executives.

**Fitting a DC-DC Converter, UBC Solar**

- Collaborated with electronics team executive to finalize placement of a new, bigger DC-DC converter on the car battery‚Äôs electronic control unit (ECU).
- Applied 3D design skills in Solidworks by modifying ECU housing.
