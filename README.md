# A bit about me

 I am fast-learning and hard-working, and I enjoy working with a team of people. I have a passion for computer hardware and software that stems from being a member of the[ UBC Solar student design team](https://ubcsolar.com/). 
 
 Outside of Solar and classes, I enjoy [landscape painting on a digital format](https://github.com/m1chellelinn/m1chellelinn/blob/939ea291932c3ab1c58e49702ff3c69864b2a7f8/artwork/description.md), music, and casual sports!

  - From this short time studying at UBC, I‚Äôm already competent in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and SystemVerilog; and practices such as embedded programming basics, testing, thread safety, documentation, and much more. At UBC Solar, I‚Äôm constantly awed by the size and complexity of circuits and firmware that go into controlling the solar car battery I‚Äôm working on.
 
  - I enjoy playing the trombone and piano. My profile picture to the left is actually taken from one of our band concerts.

  - I love cycling to school and around Vancouver, skiing at Cypress and Seymour (but it's so expensive), and swimming.
