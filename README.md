# 👋 Welcome! Here's a bit about me
I am a second year computer engineering student at UBC.
I am fast-learning, hard-working, and I enjoy working with a team of people. I have a passion for computer hardware and software that stems from being a member of the UBC Solar student design team.
Below, you can find the details of most (if not all) of my projects. Thanks for reviewing my portfolio! 😎

# All My Past Projects


### 👨‍💻 Personal Projects

---

🚧 Work in progress!

### ☀️ UBC Solar Projects

---

**Ventilation Intakes for a Battery Pack**

- Led the design of custom 3D-printed ventilation intakes for the Solar car battery to ensure sufficient cooling airflow through the battery.
- Applied the engineering design process to settle on one design that conforms to the tight geometry inside the car while moving a sufficient amount of air.
- Continuously presented design features, considerations, and drawbacks to team leads and executives during “design reviews”.

**Waterproof Cover for a Vital Circuit**

- Led the design of a custom 3D-printed water-tight enclosure to cover a vulnerable & critical circuit board on the Solar car battery.
- Applied problem-solving skills by resolving difficult design elements demanded by electronics team.
- Efficiently communicated design choices, feasibility, and performance to team executives.

**Fitting a DC-DC Converter**

- Collaborated with electronics team executive to finalize placement of a new, bigger DC-DC converter on the car battery’s electronic control unit (ECU).
- Applied 3D design skills in Solidworks by modifying ECU housing.

### 📔 UBC Course Projects

**[Client-Server Simulation Implementation](https://github.com/m1chellelinn/Client-Server-Simulation-Implementation) — CPEN221**

- Spearheaded development of our program by constructing a model of interactions between the client, “message handler”, and server.
- Ensured our team’s success in meeting the deadline by listing components of our implementation and dividing them to my teammates: Mir Ruwayd Afeef and Luc Forbes.
- Implement a multithreaded server that efficiently handles numerous clients at the same time without compromising service.
- Applied professional practices such as unit & integration testing, thread-safe programming, class & method documentation, etc.

**[Reduced Instruction-Set Computer (RISC)](https://github.com/m1chellelinn/Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer-Implementation) — CPEN211**

- Applied computer hardware principles (logic building blocks, registers, arithmetic logic unit, etc.) to write System Verilog code for a Turing-complete RISC cpu.
- Efficiently utilized the pair-programming technique with my partner, Matthew Frew, to build a correct implementation and significantly reduce debugging time.
- Rigorously tested and simulated our RISC by building testbenches for each of its components in  Modelsim.
- Went beyond course expectations and optimized our RISC implementation to achieve a cpu performance that ranked top 10 in our class.
