# 👋 Welcome! 
Below, you can find the details of most (if not all) of my projects. Thanks for reviewing my portfolio! 😎
# A bit about me
<details>
  <summary> I am a second year computer engineering student at UBC.
  I am fast-learning, hard-working, and I enjoy working with a team of people. I have a passion for computer hardware and software that stems from being a member of the UBC Solar student design team.
  </summary>
  
  - From this short time studying at UBC, I’m already competent in languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, Verilog; and practices such as testing, thread safety, documentation, and much more. At UBC Solar, I’m constantly awed by the size and complexity of circuits and firmware that go into controlling the solar car battery I’m working on.

# All My Past Projects

### 👨‍💻 Personal Projects

---

**[Python Typing Game with a GUI, Scores, and Live Feedback](https://github.com/m1chellelinn/typing-game)**
- Applied quick learning skills to complete this project within 1.5 weeks, or 14 hours
- From zero experience, learned Python syntax to be able to implement correct programs with good style
- Practiced knowledge of external libraries and advanced Python syntax to implement a typing game inspired by [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com)
- Employed Python practices: virtual environments, unit-test, and Docstrings to ensure code usability and readability

### ☀️ UBC Solar Projects

---

**Improvements to CI/CD on GitHub** 
- 🚧 Work in progress! 

**Ventilation Intakes for a Battery Pack**

- Led the design of custom 3D-printed ventilation intakes for the Solar car battery to ensure sufficient cooling airflow through the battery.
- Applied the engineering design process to settle on one design that conforms to the tight geometry inside the car while moving a sufficient amount of air.
- Continuously presented design features, considerations, and drawbacks to team leads and executives during “design reviews”.

**Waterproof Cover for a Vital Circuit**

- Led the design of a custom 3D-printed water-tight enclosure to cover a vulnerable & critical circuit board on the Solar car battery.
- Applied problem-solving skills by resolving difficult design elements demanded by electronics team.
- Efficiently communicated design choices, feasibility, and performance to team executives.

**Fitting a DC-DC Converter**

- Collaborated with electronics team executive to finalize placement of a new, bigger DC-DC converter on the car battery’s electronic control unit (ECU).
- Applied 3D design skills in Solidworks by modifying ECU housing.

(All the code for course projects are available upon request!)

&nbsp;

**Client-Server Simulation Implementation — CPEN221**

- Spearheaded development of our Java program by constructing a model of interactions between the client, “message handler,” and server.
- Ensured our team’s success in meeting the deadline by listing components of our implementation and dividing them to me and my teammates: Mir Afeef and Luc Forbes.
- Implement a multithreaded server that automatically optimizes computation to serve multiple clients without compromise.
- Applied professional practices such as unit & integration testing, thread-safe programming, and class & method documentation to produce clean code.


**Reduced Instruction-Set Computer (RISC) — CPEN211**

- Programmed a Turing-complete RISC CPU in System Verilog in 4 weeks by applying computer hardware principles.
- Efficiently utilized the pair-programming technique with my partner, Matthew Frew, to build a correct implementation and significantly reduce debugging time.
- Rigorously tested and simulated our RISC by building testbenches for each of its components in Modelsim.
- Went beyond course expectations and optimized our RISC implementation to achieve a CPU performance that ranked top 10 in our class.


**Computations & Simulations with Graphs — CPEN221**
- Programmed two robust implementations of mathematical graphs to simulate sea levels, calculate connections, and more.
- Applied leadership skills by setting team meetings and splitting tasks to my teammates: Mir Afeef and Luc Forbes.
